​
voiceSamples
object[]required
Voice samples used for cloning. For best results, provide clear audio and avoid speaking in multiple languages, whispering, or making non-verbal sounds like coughing. Instant voice cloning works best with a 10-15 sec audio clip; longer clips will be cutoff at 15sec, which can affect quality. See Voice Cloning Best Practices for guidance on how to generate a high-quality voice clone.
